# thinBasic documentation: User defined types

This is a documentation of thinBasic user defined types, aiming to cover the complete functionality.

*Currently under development*

## How to view the documentation
You may browse the MD files alone, but the recommended approach is to build the docs via `mdbook`.

The `mdbook` is a Rust tool, and as such it can be installed via:
```
cargo install mdbook
```

Once installed, please run the following command in the repository root:
```
cargo build
```

This will put `index.html` to `book` directory. Open this file in the browser of your choice ;)
